The Berners-lee Website
==========================

Explanation :
---------------
During the WevDev training at BeCode, we must have created this website based on a template. We have coded the HTML and the CSS of the page to have the same visual as demanded. This page've to be responsive as well.

So in this README, you can see my issues during this work and how I have resolved it. 

You can, of course, see the HTMl and the CSS file.

HTML issues:
-------------
First, you have to add the link for the Awesome Icon and your style.css file (even if you make the CSS part later).

The big issue that I've with the HTML part was with the Icon. The first CDN link that I used, wasn't the good one. So, I've searched the good link and modified it on the head of my HTML file.
 
I've used section for the intro, social and movie part. In the movie section tag, I've used article to organize it. 

CSS issues:
--------------
The biggest issue that I've was the social section. I didn't understand how change the Icon color, or make the paragraph below the Icon. My solution is in the HTML file. The i tag show the icon, so I changed the color in the tag and writted it before the li tag. These changes make the icon up the text and with the color I've chosen.

The second issue is related to the button shape. My mystake was to use % in the border-radius and when I used px, the button has the perfect shape.

The last one, and I don't have resolved it yet, is about the text align with the picture, in the movie section. Currently, the p tag (the three of them) aren't the same as the template and I don't find the solution. 

Responsive issues:
-------------------
The media queries are used to this part. There are in the CSS file (at the end of it).

The current issue is about the social section with the small and the medium screen. When the screen is smaller than 300px, the links and icons aren't centered on the page. And when the screen is medium (between 300 px and 768px), the three links and icons are side by side instead of below each other.
